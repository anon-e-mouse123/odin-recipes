# odin-recipes
Repository to house my Odin Project recipe site activity

In this activity I hope to practice basic html skills. I don't expect the result to look pretty, since I am not applying any sort of styling to the site. I am simply practicing basic html skills like different kinds of texts, images, links etc.
